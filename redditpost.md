[**IMPORTANT: Regarding AppSync Unified and Piracy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/)

#**Changelog ([full changelog](https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified-changelog))**

* Re-enabled `asu_inject` on 32-bit devices running the Ph≈ìnix iOS 9.3.5 jailbreak to work around a bug where rebooting and kickstarting the jailbreak would cause AppSync Unified to cease to function.

* Refactored many parts of AppSync Unified's code and removed many things that are no longer in use.

#**Unified AppSync dynamic library for iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Supports arm64.**

* AppSync Unified is **NOT** for piracy.

* AppSync Unified is for **freedom of iOS development with the official Xcode iOS SDK.**

* Jailbreaking is **NOT** for piracy.

* Jailbreaking is for **freedom of your iOS device.**

AppSync Unified is a tweak that patches installd to allow for the installation of unsigned IPA packages on an iOS device. This is particularly useful for iOS developers who are not enrolled in Apple's official iOS Developer Program, as it allows these developers to debug and test their apps on their own devices using modifications such as iOSOpenDev.

**I explain the problem with AppSync Unified and iOS piracy rather thoroughly [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/). Please give it a read.**

Again, AppSync is **NOT** meant to support piracy. Obviously it can still be used in that way, and I, nor anyone else can really stop you if you want to pirate, but please **don't pirate and support the developers!**
